## What is spawn-next-app?

- `spawn-next-app` is an alternative to the official Next.js `create-next-app` command.
- It comes with several built-in features, such as:
  - Templates for Next.js authentication (using Next.Auth)
  - Templates for theming, including a context and provider

This means you don't have to manually set up these features, saving you time and allowing you to focus on developing your app. ‚ú®

## Currently only for TypeScript

**JS templates coming soon!**

## How to use

1. Install the package using `npm i spawn-next-app`.
2. Run the command `npx spawn-next-app spawn`.
3. Fill out the basic information, and your new Next.js app will be ready!

**Note:** You will still need to manually download the project dependencies.
